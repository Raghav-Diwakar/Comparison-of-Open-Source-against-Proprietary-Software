# **Comparison of Open Source vs. Proprietary Software**  

## **Introduction**  
Software is a critical part of the modern world, powering everything from websites and enterprise solutions to artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. When choosing software, individuals and organizations must decide between **open-source software (OSS)** and **proprietary (closed-source) software**.  

Open-source software provides access to its source code, enabling users to modify, distribute, and enhance it freely. On the other hand, proprietary software is developed, owned, and distributed by a company, requiring users to pay for licenses and restricting modifications.  

This article provides an **in-depth comparison** of both software types, exploring **advantages, disadvantages, real-world examples, security considerations, industry adoption, and future trends**.
